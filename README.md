# What

Trying to learn some graphics and some [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) following the book(s) [Ray Tracing in One Weekend — The Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io).

All (almost) commits have the .ppm file the code at that point generate.

# How to run

Build (zig 0.14.1)
```bash
zig build-exe main.zig
```

Run
```bash
./main > image.ppm
```

The output is a image.ppm file. Most of OS opens it with an image visualizer.
